# Simple Network
This lab involves setting up a simple WiFi network using a 2504 WLC and 4 Lightweight Access Points, each serving a specific organizational department: Sales, Accounts, Staff, and Guest APs. They will all be in one VLAN on the 192.168.10.0/24 network, with a DHCP server configured to issue IPs. Each LWAP will be assigned to an organizational group and will serve one department.

## Initial Setup
The setup looks as shown below:
