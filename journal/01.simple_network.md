# Simple Network
This lab involves setting up a simple WiFi network using a 2504 WLC and 4 Lightweight Access Points, each serving a specific organizational department: Sales, Accounts, Staff, and Guest APs.

They will all be in one VLAN on the 192.168.10.0/24 network, with a DHCP server configured to issue IPs. Each LWAP will be assigned to an organizational group and will serve one department.

## Initial Setup

The setup looks as shown below:

The first step was to configure the WLC's IP address, which I did as shown below:

Next, I configured static IPs on the management PC and DHCP server.

After completing that, I set up the DHCP service by enabling it and configuring the DHCP pool, along with the WLC IP address that the LWAPs would connect to. Following this, I powered on the LWAPs and ensured that their gateway IP was set to DHCP.

## WLC Configuration

After completing those tasks, I performed a ping test from my management PC to establish a connection to the WLC. Once I received a response, I opened my browser and entered the WLC's IP address. This led me to a landing page where I set up a username and password. I then proceeded with the first step of initialization by configuring the SALES WiFi.

Once that was completed, I closed the browser tab and then reopened it using HTTPS and the WLC's IP to establish a connection. This time, I accessed a summary page that showed the 4 LWAPs successfully associated with the WLC.
