# Simple Network
This lab involves setting up a simple WiFi network using a 2504 WLC and 4 Lightweight Access Points, each serving a specific organizational department: Sales, Accounts, Staff, and Guest APs.

They will all be in one VLAN; on the 192.168.10.0/24 network, with a DHCP server configured to issue IPs. Each LWAP will be assigned to an organizational group and will serve one department.

## Initial Setup

The setup looks as shown below:

The first step was to configure the WLC's IP address, which I did as shown below:

Next, I configured static IPs on the management PC and DHCP server.

After completing that, I set up the DHCP service by enabling it and configuring the DHCP pool, along with the WLC IP address that the LWAPs would connect to. Following this, I powered on the LWAPs and ensured that their gateway IP was set to DHCP.

## WLC Configuration

After completing those tasks, I performed a ping test from my management PC to establish a connection to the WLC. Once I received a response, I opened my browser and entered the WLC's IP address. This led me to a landing page where I set up a username and password. I then proceeded with the first step of initialization by configuring the SALES WiFi.

Once that was completed, I closed the browser tab and then reopened it using HTTPS and the WLC's IP to establish a connection. This time, I accessed a summary page that showed the 4 LWAPs successfully associated with the WLC.

Clicking on the WLAN tab at the top, I proceeded to create the Accounts profile and SSID. After enabling it, I clicked on the Security tab. Under Layer 2 Security, I selected the WPA+WPA2 option and chose the WPA policy with AES encryption. For authentication, I selected PSK and set the password to "Accounts123".

Next, I proceeded to create the Staff and Guest WLANs using the same method.

On the left menu tab, there's an AP Groups section with a default group that hosts all 4 APs. I created each organizational group with the following names:

As it stands now, each LWAP is providing all 4 WLANs. The plan is to configure each LWAP to provide only one WLAN specific to its assigned department.

On the Sales AP Group, under the AP tab, I moved the SALES-AP to the Sales group. I then confirmed that the SALES-AP is now providing WLAN to the Sales department.

## Connecting to the APs

The last step was to connect the devices to their respective AP groups. Due to Packet Tracer's limitations, not all groups could connect simultaneously. After rebooting Packet Tracer, another group connected while the previous one didn't, indicating that the configurations are correct, but the limitations of Packet Tracer can't be fully worked around.
