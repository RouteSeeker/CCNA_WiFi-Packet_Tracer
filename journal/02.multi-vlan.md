# Multi-VLAN Setup Lab

## Overview
This lab builds on the previous setup where we had a single WiFi VLAN servicing four different departments. Each LWAP (Lightweight Access Point) was assigned to a specific department. In this lab, we will create separate VLANs for each department: Accounts, Sales, Staff, and Guest, with each having its own VLAN.

## Objectives
- Create and configure four VLANs: Accounts, Sales, Staff, and Guest.
- Use a DHCP/AAA server for IP address assignment and authentication.
- Configure a router for inter-VLAN routing.
- Set up a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and three LWAPs.
- Assign each LWAP to broadcast multiple SSIDs, each corresponding to the four VLANs.

## Network Details
- **Management VLAN:** 192.168.99.0/24
- **Accounts VLAN (VLAN 10):** 192.168.10.0/24
- **Sales VLAN (VLAN 30):** 192.168.30.0/24
- **Staff VLAN (VLAN 40):** 192.168.40.0/24
- **Server Network:** 192.168.1.0/24

## Equipment and Topology
- **DHCP/AAA Server:** To provide IP addresses and authentication services.
- **Router:** To perform inter-VLAN routing.
- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC):** To manage LWAPs.
- **3 LWAPs:** To provide wireless access to different VLANs.

## Steps

### 1. VLAN Configuration
1. **Create VLANs on the Switch:**
   - VLAN 10: Accounts
   - VLAN 30: Sales
   - VLAN 40: Staff
   - VLAN 50: Guest
   - VLAN 99: Management

2. **Assign Ports to VLANs:**
   - Configure switch ports connected to LWAPs as trunk ports.
   - Assign appropriate VLANs to each port connected to wired devices (e.g., DHCP/AAA Server, Router, etc.).

### 2. DHCP Server Configuration
1. **Set up DHCP Scopes for each VLAN:**
   - **Accounts VLAN (10):** 192.168.10.0/24
   - **Sales VLAN (30):** 192.168.30.0/24
   - **Staff VLAN (40):** 192.168.40.0/24
   - **Guest VLAN (50):** 192.168.50.0/24

2. **Configure the Server's IP Address:** Ensure it has a static IP address in the Server Network (192.168.1.0/24).

### 3. Router Configuration
1. **Configure Sub-Interfaces for Each VLAN:**
   - Router sub-interface for VLAN 10: 192.168.10.1/24
   - Router sub-interface for VLAN 30: 192.168.30.1/24
   - Router sub-interface for VLAN 40: 192.168.40.1/24
   - Router sub-interface for VLAN 50: 192.168.50.1/24

2. **Enable Routing:**
   - Configure routing between VLANs.
   - Ensure the router has a route to the Management VLAN (192.168.99.0/24).

### 4. WLC Configuration
1. **Set up the Management Interface:**
   - Assign an IP address from the Management VLAN (e.g., 192.168.99.2).

2. **Configure VLANs on the WLC:**
   - Add VLAN mappings for Accounts, Sales, Staff, and Guest.

3. **Create SSIDs:**
   - Accounts: Broadcasts on VLAN 10.
   - Sales: Broadcasts on VLAN 30.
   - Staff: Broadcasts on VLAN 40.
   - Guest: Broadcasts on VLAN 50.

4. **Add LWAPs to the WLC:**
   - Ensure LWAPs are associated with the WLC.
   - Configure LWAPs to broadcast the SSIDs for the four VLANs.

### 5. LWAP Configuration
1. **Associate LWAPs with the WLC:**
   - Ensure LWAPs are properly configured to connect to the WLC.
   - Verify that LWAPs are broadcasting the correct SSIDs.

### 6. Testing and Verification
1. **Verify VLAN Assignments:**
   - Ensure devices connected to each VLAN are receiving correct IP addresses via DHCP.
   - Test connectivity between devices in different VLANs.

2. **Test Wireless Connectivity:**
   - Connect to each SSID and verify proper VLAN assignment.
   - Test internet connectivity and access to internal resources.

3. **Check Inter-VLAN Routing:**
   - Ping between devices on different VLANs to ensure routing is working correctly.
