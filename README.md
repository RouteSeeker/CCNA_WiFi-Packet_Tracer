# CCNA_WiFi-Packet_Tracer
I decided to tackle this lab to set up a simple WiFi network with a WLC and 4 LWAPs, each covering a specific organizational department. In my last lab, I faced challenges getting the LWAPs to associate with the WLC. After many attempts, I realized it might be a Packet Tracer limitation.

I'll start with a simple network and gradually move to more complex setups. Eventually, when Packet Tracer can handle it, I'll complete my initial 3-tier network. Come along and join me on this WiFi network journey. Woohoo!
